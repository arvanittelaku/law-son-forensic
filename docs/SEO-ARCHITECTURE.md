# SEO Architecture — Lawson Forensic

**Domain:** https://www.lawsonforensic.com  
**Last updated:** June 2026  
**Site type:** Branded boutique forensic accounting firm website (not a generic lead-generation directory)

---

## Strategic goals

1. **Branded search dominance** — Rank for “Lawson Forensic” and related branded queries so instructing solicitors and referrers find the official site first.
2. **Authoritative service visibility** — Rank for forensic accounting and expert witness queries where on-site content demonstrates genuine, court-facing expertise.

All SEO decisions must support both goals without compromising brand integrity or the expert’s duty-to-court positioning.

---

## 1. Keyword strategy

Keywords are organised in three tiers. Lawson Forensic does not chase volume for its own sake; each target keyword must map to a page that can answer the query authoritatively.

---

## 2. Content strategy — branded site approach

Unlike generic keyword sites, lawsonforensic.com builds authority through depth, specificity, and verifiable expertise—not thin service pages or location spam.

### Four authority pillars

| Pillar | Route | Purpose | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thought leadership | `/insights` | Quarterly articles targeting informational Tier 2 keywords | `lib/data/insights.ts` |
| Case study narratives | `/case-studies` | Proof of court-facing work (most competitors have none) | `lib/data/case-studies.ts` |
| Transparent process | `/how-we-work` | Trust and conversion support for solicitor referrals | Page content (TBD) |
| Credentials depth | `/qualifications-accreditations` | Verifiable, specific accreditations | Page content (TBD) |

### Content clusters

Clusters are organised around **practice areas**, not isolated keyword themes. Each practice area page links to relevant insights, case studies, and services.

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  subgraph hub [SiteHub]
    Home["/"]
    Services["/services"]
  end
  subgraph clusters [PracticeAreaClusters]
    CD["commercial-disputes"]
    FF["fraud-financial-crime"]
    FP["family-proceedings"]
    PI["personal-injury-clinical-negligence"]
    IA["insolvency-administration"]
    RP["regulatory-proceedings"]
  end
  subgraph authority [AuthorityContent]
    Insights["/insights"]
    CaseStudies["/case-studies"]

    Quals["/qualifications-accreditations"]
  end
  Home --> Services
  Services --> clusters
  clusters --> Insights
  clusters --> CaseStudies
  HowWeWork --> Home
  Quals --> Home
```

### Publishing cadence

- **Minimum:** 4 insights articles per year at launch (quarterly).
- **Target:** 8 insights articles per year once established.
- **Case studies:** Add narrative case studies as matters permit (anonymised); no minimum frequency, but quality over quantity.

### Planned route map

| # | Route | File (App Router) | Index? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `/` | `app/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 2 | `/about` | `app/about/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 3 | `/services` | `app/services/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 4 | `/services/[slug]` | `app/services/[slug]/page.tsx` | Yes (×6) |
| 5 | `/practice-areas` | `app/practice-areas/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 6 | `/practice-areas/[slug]` | `app/practice-areas/[slug]/page.tsx` | Yes (×6) |
| 7 | `/case-studies` | `app/case-studies/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 8 | `/qualifications-accreditations` | `app/qualifications-accreditations/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 9 | `/how-we-work` | `app/how-we-work/page.tsx` | Yes |

| 11 | `/insights` | `app/insights/page.tsx` | Yes |
| 12 | `/insights/[slug]` | `app/insights/[slug]/page.tsx` | Yes (×4 at launch) |
| 13 | `/contact` | `app/contact/page.tsx` | Yes (sitemap; form converts) |
| — | `/expert-witness`, `/investigations`, `/fees` | Redirects | 301 to services/contact |
| 16 | `/thank-you` | `app/thank-you/page.tsx` | **No** (`noindex`) |

| 19 | `/terms` | `app/terms/page.tsx` | **No** (`noindex`) |

---

## 3. Entity optimisation

Google’s Knowledge Graph and local entity signals depend on consistent identity across the web. The canonical entity name is **Lawson Forensic** everywhere.

### Entity name and NAP

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Name** | Lawson Forensic |
| **Website** | https://www.lawsonforensic.com |
| **Email** | info@lawsonforensic.com |
| **Phone** | *(Confirm before publishing on GBP and schema)* |
| **Address** | *(Confirm before publishing on GBP and schema; UK national practice)* |

NAP (Name, Address, Phone) must match exactly on: website footer, Google Business Profile, LinkedIn, directory listings, and any schema `PostalAddress` once confirmed.

### sameAs and directory presence

**Current implementation** (`lib/schema.ts`): `sameAs` includes LinkedIn only via `NEXT_PUBLIC_LINKEDIN_URL` (default: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/lawson-forensic`).

**Target sameAs expansion** (add URLs to schema when listings are live):

| Platform | Handle / listing | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn company page | lawsonforensic | Create page; link in schema `sameAs` |
| Google Business Profile | Lawson Forensic | Create profile (see Section 6) |
| UK Register of Expert Witnesses | jspubs.com | Submit listing; name: Lawson Forensic |
| Academy of Experts | Member listing | Submit; consistent name |
| Expert Witness Institute (EWI) | Member listing | Submit; consistent name |
| ICAEW | Firm listing | Submit if applicable |
| ACFE UK Chapter | Directory | Optional directory presence |

**Future env pattern:** When multiple directory URLs exist, consider `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAME_AS_URLS` (comma-separated) merged into `sameAs` in `lib/schema.ts`.

### Person schema policy

**Do not add Person schema with placeholder or generic practitioner details.**

On a branded expert witness site, fake or vague Person markup signals low trust. Add Person schema only when:

- Real practitioner name, role, and credentials are confirmed for publication
- A dedicated team or profile page exists with substantive content
- `sameAs` can link to verifiable professional profiles (e.g. LinkedIn individual, ICAEW register)

Until then, use **Organization** as `author` on Article schema (already implemented in `articleSchema()`).

### Off-site entity checklist

- [ ] Create LinkedIn company page: **Lawson Forensic**
- [ ] Create Google Business Profile: **Lawson Forensic**
- [ ] Submit to jspubs.com (UK Register of Expert Witnesses)
- [ ] Submit to Academy of Experts member directory
- [ ] Submit to Expert Witness Institute listing
- [ ] Submit ICAEW firm listing (if applicable)
- [ ] Verify NAP consistency across all platforms

## 4. Schema architecture

Structured data reinforces the **Lawson Forensic** entity and connects services, content, and FAQs to that entity.

### Root entity

```json
{
  "@type": "Organization",
  "@id": "https://www.lawsonforensic.com/#organization",
  "name": "Lawson Forensic",
  "url": "https://www.lawsonforensic.com"
}
```

  BC["BreadcrumbList non-home pages"]
  Org --> HomePS

  BC --> Org
```

### Children by page type

| Schema type | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Organization | Homepage `@graph` | Root; `@id` `/#organization` |
| ProfessionalService | Homepage `@graph` | `serviceType`: Forensic Accounting; `hasOfferCatalog` with 6 services |
| WebSite + SearchAction | Homepage `@graph` | Search targets `/insights?q={search_term_string}` |
| Service (×6) | `/services` page + catalog on homepage | IDs: `#expert-witness`, `#fraud-investigation`, etc. |
| Article (×4 at launch) | `/insights/[slug]` | Organization as author |
| FAQPage | `/faq` | `lib/data/faq.ts` → `siteFaqs` |
| FAQPage | `/practice-areas/[slug]` | Per-area `faqs` in `lib/data/practice-areas.ts` |
| BreadcrumbList | All non-homepage pages | `breadcrumbSchema()` |

### Page injection matrix

| Page | JSON-LD types | Helper (`lib/schema.ts`) | Data source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Organization, WebSite, SearchAction, ProfessionalService, OfferCatalog | `homepageSchema()` | Inline service definitions in schema file |
| `/services` | 6× Service | `servicesPageSchema()` | Same 6 services as homepage catalog |
| `/insights/[slug]` | Article | `articleSchema(article)` | `lib/data/insights.ts` |
| `/faq` | FAQPage | `faqPageSchema(faqs)` | `lib/data/faq.ts` |
| `/practice-areas/[slug]` | FAQPage | `faqPageSchema(area.faqs)` | `lib/data/practice-areas.ts` |
| All non-home | BreadcrumbList | `breadcrumbSchema(items)` | Per-page breadcrumb trail |

### Six services (schema IDs)

| Service ID | Name |
| --- | --- |
| `expert-witness` | Expert Witness Reports |
| `fraud-investigation` | Fraud Investigation |
| `asset-tracing` | Asset Tracing |
| `business-valuation` | Business Valuation |
| `loss-quantification` | Loss Quantification |
| `family-matrimonial-accounting` | Family & Matrimonial Accounting |

### Implementation status

| Component | Status | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Schema builder functions | **Implemented** | `lib/schema.ts` |
| `jsonLdScript()` serializer | **Implemented** | `lib/schema.ts` |
| React `JsonLd` component | **Implemented** | `components/seo/JsonLd.tsx` |
| Per-page schema injection | **Implemented** | All indexable `app/**/page.tsx` |
| Keyword map | **Implemented** | `lib/seo/keywordMap.ts` |
| Internal linking (Appendix D) | **Implemented** | `lib/seo/internalLinks.ts`, `InternalLinksSection` |
| `sameAs` expansion | **Implemented** | `NEXT_PUBLIC_SAME_AS_URLS` + LinkedIn |

**Required `JsonLd` component pattern:**

```tsx
// components/seo/JsonLd.tsx
import { jsonLdScript } from "@/lib/schema";

export function JsonLd({ data }: { data: object }) {
  return (
    <script
      type="application/ld+json"
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={jsonLdScript(data)}
    />
  );
}
```

Homepage example:

```tsx
import { homepageSchema } from "@/lib/schema";
import { JsonLd } from "@/components/seo/JsonLd";

export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <>
      <JsonLd data={homepageSchema()} />
      {/* page content */}
    </>
  );
}
```

## 5. Link building strategy

Branded firm sites require a different link profile than keyword directories. Links should reinforce professional credibility and referral trust, not manipulate rankings with irrelevant placements.

### Priority 1 — Professional body listings

| Target | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| ICAEW member firm listing | Professional credibility signal |
| Academy of Experts member listing | Expert witness directory presence |
| Expert Witness Institute listing | Court-facing specialist recognition |
| UK Register of Expert Witnesses (jspubs.com) | Solicitor search behaviour |
| ACFE UK Chapter directory | Fraud investigation credibility |

### Priority 2 — Resolution / Law Society directories

| Target | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Resolution (family law) | Family proceedings referral network |
| Law Society expert finder | Cross-practice solicitor discovery |

### Priority 3 — Thought leadership citation building

Publish `/insights` articles and pitch republication or citation in:

- Family Law Week
- Commercial Dispute Resolution (CDR)
- Fraud Intelligence
- ICAEW *economia*
- Lexology

Each citation should link to the canonical article URL on lawsonforensic.com.

### Priority 4 — Referral network

**Primary lead generation is solicitor referral**, not organic contact forms. The website validates and supports that network:

- Every instructing solicitor is a potential repeat referrer
- Case studies and insights give solicitors material to share internally
- Qualifications and process pages reduce friction for first-time instructions
- Do not compete with referral relationships via aggressive directory SEO

---

## 6. Local SEO

Even for a UK-national practice, a Google Business Profile creates a **local entity signal** and supports branded search disambiguation.

### Google Business Profile specification

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Business name** | Lawson Forensic |
| **Category** | Forensic Accountant |
| **Website** | https://www.lawsonforensic.com |
| **Description** | UK boutique forensic accounting practice providing expert witness reports and financial investigation services. |
| **Service area** | United Kingdom (if applicable to profile type) |
| **NAP** | Must match website and directory listings exactly |

### Actions

- [ ] Create and verify Google Business Profile
- [ ] Add website URL and primary category
- [ ] Align NAP with site footer and schema once address/phone confirmed
- [ ] Request reviews only from genuine clients where appropriate (no incentive schemes)

---

## 7. Insights content calendar

Regular publishing signals active expertise and creates new keyword surfaces over time.

### Cadence rules

- **Launch minimum:** 4 articles per year (quarterly)
- **Growth target:** 8 articles per year
- Each article must map to at least one Tier 2 keyword and link to relevant practice area pages

### Q1 2026 (launch) — implemented in `lib/data/insights.ts`

| Article | Slug | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instructing a Forensic Accountant | `instructing-forensic-accountant-guide` | **Content ready** |
| Business Valuation in Divorce | `business-valuation-divorce-guide` | **Content ready** |
| POCA Benefit Calculations | `poca-benefit-calculation-guide` | **Content ready** |
| Choosing an SJE | `choosing-single-joint-expert` | **Content ready** |

### Q2 2026 — planned

| Article | Suggested slug | Practice area link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loss of Profits Claims: Methodology Guide | `loss-of-profits-methodology` | `commercial-disputes` |

| Fraud Loss vs POCA Benefit: Key Distinctions | `fraud-loss-vs-poca-benefit` | `fraud-financial-crime` |
| Shareholder Disputes: Fair Value vs Fair Market Value | `shareholder-dispute-fair-value` | `commercial-disputes` |

### Q3 2026 — planned

| Article | Suggested slug | Practice area link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ERA 2025 and Employment Loss Expert Evidence | `era-2025-employment-loss-evidence` | `personal-injury-clinical-negligence` |
| Audit Negligence: ISA Standards and Expert Witnesses | `audit-negligence-isa-standards` | `commercial-disputes` |
| Completion Accounts: The Agreed Accounting Basis Explained | `completion-accounts-accounting-basis` | `commercial-disputes` |
| Lifestyle Analysis in Financial Remedy: Methodology | `lifestyle-analysis-financial-remedy` | `family-proceedings` |

When Q2/Q3 articles are written, add entries to `lib/data/insights.ts` and include URLs in `app/sitemap.ts`.

---

## 8. Competitive positioning

Lawson Forensic sits in the **premium boutique** segment of the UK forensic accounting market.

### Market context

| Segment | Characteristics | Lawson Forensic contrast |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Big 4 / Top-10 (Grant Thornton, Kroll, FTI) | Higher cost, junior team involvement, less responsive, less boutique | Senior-led throughout; responsive; full-service boutique |
| Solo practitioners (jspubs listings) | Limited scope, variable QC, limited court experience | Full-service scope; court-ready quality; consistent methodology |

### On-site expression

Positioning must be **implicit** on every page:

- Demonstrate senior involvement and methodology in case studies and insights
- Use specific procedural references (CPR Part 35, FPR Part 25, CrPR Part 33, POCA, SJE)
- Avoid generic marketing superlatives (“leading”, “number one”, “best in UK”)
- Never state “premium boutique” explicitly; show it through content depth and precision

## Appendix A — Title tag patterns

| Page type | Pattern | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Homepage | `Lawson Forensic \| Forensic Accounting & Expert Witness UK` | Branded + service hint |
| Standard inner page | `{Page Title} \| Lawson Forensic` | `Expert Witness \| Lawson Forensic` |

| Insight article | `{Article Title} \| Lawson Forensic` | Article H1 as title |
| Thank you / legal | `{Page Title} \| Lawson Forensic` | With `noindex` |

Use `buildMetadata()` from `lib/metadata.ts` on every page.

---

## Appendix B — Meta description guidelines

- **Language:** UK English (`en-GB`)
- **Length:** 150–160 characters where possible
- **Content:** One clear proposition + one differentiator (senior-led, CPR/FPR compliance, SJE availability) where natural
- **Avoid:** Keyword stuffing, superlatives, duplicate descriptions across pages
- **Branded pages:** Include “Lawson Forensic” on homepage and about; service pages may lead with capability

---

## Appendix C — Robots and indexation policy

| Route | `robots` |
| --- | --- |
| All public marketing pages | `index, follow` |
| `/thank-you` | `noindex, follow` |
| `/privacy` | `noindex, follow` |
| `/terms` | `noindex, follow` |

Pass `noindex: true` to `buildMetadata()` for excluded routes.

---

## Appendix D — Internal linking rules

1. **Homepage** → Services, Expert Witness, top practice areas, latest insight, contact.
2. **Practice area pages** → Relevant services (`/expert-witness`, `/investigations`), related insights, case studies, contact.
3. **Insights** → Relevant practice area(s), expert witness page, contact CTA at article end.
4. **Services** → Each service links to `href` in `lib/data/services.ts` (practice area or dedicated page).
5. **FAQ** → Link to practice areas and `/how-we-work` for process detail.
6. **Footer** (sitewide) → Practice areas, insights, qualifications, contact; consistent NAP when confirmed.

Use descriptive anchor text (“Family Proceedings practice area”, “instructing a forensic accountant guide”)—not “click here”.

---

## Appendix E — Follow-on implementation tasks

When building `app/` routes, complete in this order:

1. `components/seo/JsonLd.tsx` + wire schema per page injection matrix
2. `app/layout.tsx` — `lang="en-GB"`, hreflang, verification, default metadata
3. Per-page `buildMetadata()` with unique title/description
4. `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts`
5. Breadcrumb component + `breadcrumbSchema()` on all non-home pages
6. Insights index with links to all articles; optional client search for `SearchAction`
7. Expand `sameAs` when directory URLs are confirmed
8. Add Person schema only when practitioner profiles are ready for publication

---

## Document maintenance

Update this document when:

- New insights slugs are added to `lib/data/insights.ts`
- NAP or `sameAs` URLs are confirmed
- Person schema is approved for publication
- New practice areas or services are introduced
- Search Console shows new branded or service query opportunities worth targeting with content
